Graduate Rotational Internship Program (Data Science &amp; Data Analytics Internship).

I received a dataset named SampleSuperstore and this dataset has 13 columns ('Ship Mode', 'Segment', 'Country', 'City', 'State', 'Postal Code', 'Region', 'Category', 'Sub-Category', 'Sales', 'Quantity', 'Discount', 'Profit') and 9977 rows in it.

First I had to run some commands like .info() and .describe() etc. to have a quick look of the dataset to understand it better.
After understanding the dataset I found out that this dataset had 0 null values but had some duplicate values in it so I dropped those duplicate values and after getting rid of those duplicate values I started my Analysis part where I used bar chart, pie chart and line chart to visualize the insights.
